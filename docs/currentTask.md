# Current Task: Investigate and Fix Remaining "Maximum Update Depth Exceeded" Error

## Current Objectives

1. **Performance Improvements** ✅
    -   Implemented local storage caching for sessions and messages
    -   Added pagination to message loading
    -   Optimized database queries
    -   Added optimistic updates for better UX

2. **Code Refactoring** ✅
    -   Split the large `useChat` hook into smaller, more focused hooks:
        -   `useSessions` for managing chat sessions
        -   `useMessages` for managing messages and pagination
    -   Created a new `useChat` hook that orchestrates `useSessions` and `useMessages`
    -   Moved shared types to `src/lib/types/chat.ts`
    -   Created `src/lib/utils/api.ts` for API-related utilities
    -   Created `src/lib/utils/cache.ts` for cache management utilities

3. **Investigate and Fix Remaining "Maximum Update Depth Exceeded" Error**
    -   Identify the root cause of the error
    -   Implement a fix that prevents the infinite update loop
    -   Thoroughly test the application to ensure the error is resolved

## Relevant Context

The "Maximum update depth exceeded" error is a React error that occurs when a component repeatedly calls `setState` inside `componentWillUpdate` or `componentDidUpdate`, leading to an infinite loop. The error message suggests that the issue might be related to how state updates are handled in the application.

The recent refactoring and performance improvements have addressed some potential causes, but the error still persists. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause and implement a fix.

## Technical Details

### Refactoring

-   Created `src/hooks/use-sessions.ts` for managing chat sessions
-   Created `src/hooks/use-messages.ts` for managing messages
-   Refactored `src/hooks/use-chat.ts` to use the new hooks
-   Moved shared types to `src/lib/types/chat.ts`
-   Created `src/lib/utils/api.ts` for API utilities
-   Created `src/lib/utils/cache.ts` for cache management

### Performance Improvements

-   Implemented local storage caching for sessions and messages
-   Added pagination to message loading
-   Optimized database queries
-   Added optimistic updates for better UX

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate the Error**
    -   [ ] Use React DevTools profiler to identify components causing unnecessary re-renders
    -   [ ] Review state updates in `useSessions`, `useMessages`, and `ChatInterface`
    -   [ ] Check for potential issues with third-party components (e.g., `TooltipProvider`)
2. **Implement a Fix**
    -   [ ] Address the root cause of the infinite update loop
    -   [ ] Ensure that state updates are handled correctly and efficiently
3. **Thoroughly Test**
    -   [ ] Test the application to ensure the error is resolved
    -   [ ] Verify that all features are working as expected
    -   [ ] Conduct performance testing to ensure the improvements are effective

## Dependencies

-   React
-   Next.js
-   Radix UI
-   React DevTools (for debugging)

## Notes

The refactoring and performance improvements have significantly enhanced the application's codebase and user experience. However, the remaining "Maximum update depth exceeded" error needs to be addressed to ensure the application's stability and reliability.
