# Current Task: Add Persistent Storage

## Current Objectives
- Implement persistent storage capabilities to the application.
- This feature is listed under "Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)" in `projectRoadmap.md`.

## Relevant Context
- The `projectRoadmap.md` indicates that the MVP version is complete.
- The next phase is to add future enhancements, starting with persistent storage.
- Persistent storage will allow users to save and retrieve application state, such as chat history and comparison configurations.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Research different persistent storage options suitable for Next.js applications (e.g., local storage, browser cookies, cloud-based databases).
- [ ] Choose the most appropriate storage solution based on project requirements and scalability considerations outlined in `projectRoadmap.md`.
- [ ] Update `techStack.md` with the chosen storage solution and justification.
- [ ] Implement the chosen storage solution in the application, starting with a simple feature like saving chat history.
- [ ] Test the persistent storage implementation thoroughly.
- [ ] Update `codebaseSummary.md` to reflect the addition of persistent storage.
- [ ] Document the implementation details in `techStack.md` and potentially create a new document like `dataPersistence.md` if needed.
