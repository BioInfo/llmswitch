# Current Task: Code Refactoring and Deepseek Integration Fix

## Current Objectives

1. Refactor API Route Structure ✅
   - Moved model-specific logic to `src/lib/models`
   - Created `deepseek.ts` and `claude.ts` for handling API calls
   - Created `src/lib/types/models.ts` for shared types
   - Created `src/lib/utils/async.ts` for shared async utilities
   - Updated `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to use new structure

2. Fix Deepseek Integration ✅
   - Updated to use `deepseek-reasoner` model
   - Properly handle `reasoning_content` in API response
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Added robust response validation and parsing

3. Improve Comparative Analysis ✅
   - Updated analysis prompt to focus on reasoning transfer
   - Added specific instructions for analysis content
   - Implemented better error handling and display
   - Added more detailed logging

4. Ensure Data Consistency ✅
   - Fixed type mismatches between database and application
   - Added type guards and conversion utilities
   - Updated `MessageList` component to display reasoning

5. Document Changes ✅
   - Updated `currentTask.md` with completed tasks
   - Updated `codebaseSummary.md` to reflect the new file structure
   - Added detailed documentation to the session tracker

6. Commit and Push Changes ✅
   - Committed all changes to `feature/database` branch
   - Pushed changes to remote repository

7. Merge into Main and Deploy ✅
   - Merged `feature/database` branch into `main`
   - Pushed `main` branch to trigger deployment on Vercel

## Relevant Context

These changes improve the codebase's maintainability, enhance the Deepseek integration, and fix issues with the comparative analysis feature. They also address the problem of Deepseek responses not being displayed in the chat interface. The code has been refactored into a more modular structure, and type safety has been improved.

## Technical Details

### Refactoring

- Created `src/lib/models` to hold model-specific API handlers.
- Created `src/lib/types` for shared TypeScript types.
- Created `src/lib/utils` for common utility functions.
- Updated `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to use these new modules.

### Deepseek Integration

- Updated `callDeepseek` to use the `deepseek-reasoner` model.
- Added proper handling of the `reasoning_content` field in the API response.
- Implemented robust error handling, including retries with exponential backoff.
- Added detailed logging for requests and responses.

### Comparative Analysis

- Modified `getComparativeAnalysis` to use a more detailed and structured prompt.
- Added specific instructions for what to include in each section of the analysis.
- Implemented better error handling and user feedback.

### Data Consistency

- Created `DbMessage` and `DbChatSession` types to mirror the database schema.
- Added `convertDbMessageToMessage` and `convertDbSessionToSession` to convert between database and application types.
- Updated `MessageList` to handle and display the `reasoning` field.

## Next Steps

1. Testing
   - [ ] Verify successful deployment on Vercel.
   - [ ] Thoroughly test the application to ensure all features are working as expected.
   - [ ] Conduct further testing on the Deepseek integration and comparative analysis.

2. Monitoring
   - [ ] Monitor application logs for any errors or performance issues.
   - [ ] Track user feedback on the new features.

3. Future Enhancements
   - [ ] Consider implementing streaming responses for a better user experience.
   - [ ] Add caching for frequently used prompts and analyses.
   - [ ] Implement a more sophisticated analysis algorithm for comparing model responses.

## Dependencies

- Deepseek API
- Claude API
- Next.js
- Prisma ORM

## Notes

The refactoring and improvements made in this task significantly enhance the application's functionality, maintainability, and user experience. The deployment to Vercel is in progress.
