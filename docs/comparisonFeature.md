# Model Comparison Feature

## Overview
The model comparison feature allows users to compare responses from different LLM models (Deepseek R1, Claude, and Claude with Reasoning) across various types of prompts. It includes a comparative analysis that highlights differences, similarities, and strengths of each approach.

## Components

### Prompt Selection
- Six diverse prompt categories:
  1. Ethical Dilemma
  2. Logic Puzzle
  3. Creative Problem
  4. Complex Analysis
  5. Abstract Reasoning
  6. Systems Thinking
- Interactive cards with hover states
- Clear prompt descriptions

### Response Generation
- Parallel requests to different models
- Enhanced Claude response using Deepseek's reasoning
- Structured response format for consistency
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Comparative Analysis
- Generated by Deepseek R1
- Structured sections:
  1. Key Differences in Approach
  2. Shared Elements
  3. Standout Strengths
  4. Effectiveness Analysis
- Bullet-point format for clarity
- Direct quotes and specific examples

### UI Features
- Collapsible reasoning sections
- Clean text rendering
- Visual hierarchy
- Responsive layout
- Loading states with AI-themed jokes

## Text Processing

### Cleaning Functions
```typescript
// Text cleaning pipeline for consistent formatting
- Remove LaTeX delimiters and formatting
- Handle mathematical expressions
- Normalize whitespace and line breaks
- Clean special characters
- Ensure proper spacing
- Format bullet points and sections
```

### Display Formatting
- Proper spacing between sentences
- Mathematical expression rendering
- Clean bullet point presentation
- Section headers with visual separators
- Gradient backgrounds for emphasis

## Implementation Details

### Response Structure
```typescript
interface ComparisonState {
  [key: string]: {
    content: string
    reasoning?: string | null
  }
}
```

### Analysis Format
- Hierarchical structure with main sections and subsections
- Bullet points for detailed observations
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Gradient accents for visual hierarchy

## Best Practices

### Response Handling
- Validate all API responses
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide loading feedback
- Clean and normalize text
- Preserve mathematical accuracy

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Consistent spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Smooth animations
