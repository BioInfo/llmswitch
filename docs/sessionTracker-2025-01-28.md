# Session Tracker: 2025-01-28

## Session Metadata

- **Date:** 2025-01-28
- **Start Time:** 08:45 AM (Europe/London, UTC+0:00)
- **End Time:** 4:57 PM (Europe/London, UTC+0:00)
- **Phase:** Implementation & Bug Fixing

## Session Summary

This session focused on fixing several critical issues with the chat interface and Deepseek integration. The following tasks were completed:

### Interface Improvements
- Fixed dropdown menu functionality using proper shadcn/ui components
- Implemented proper ref forwarding in menu components
- Fixed the new chat functionality to prevent automatic session loading
- Added proper state management for new chat sessions

### Deepseek Integration Enhancements
- Changed model name from "deepseek-reasoner" to "deepseek-chat"
- Implemented two-part request flow for better content/reasoning separation
- Added detailed error logging for API responses
- Improved conversation context handling
- Added timeout handling and retry logic

### Documentation & Code Structure
- Updated documentation to reflect new changes
- Added debug logging throughout API calls
- Improved error message clarity
- Added response validation

## Files Modified

- `src/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`
- `src/hooks/use-chat.ts`
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `docs/sessionTracker-2025-01-28.md`

## Decisions Made

- Decided to handle reasoning as a separate API call for clearer separation
- Chose to implement proper two-way chat context for reasoning requests
- Opted for increased timeout values to handle longer model responses
- Implemented explicit error handling for API format mismatches

## Challenges Faced

- **Dropdown Menu Issues**: Resolved issues with ref forwarding and component hierarchy
- **New Chat State**: Fixed problems with automatic session loading
- **Deepseek API Integration**: Addressed timeout issues and invalid response formats
- **Error Handling**: Improved error capture and display throughout the application

## Remaining Issues

1. **Testing Needed**:
   - Full testing of Deepseek chat completions with various inputs
   - Verification of error handling in edge cases
   - Load testing with longer conversations

2. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Consider implementing streaming responses
   - Add rate limiting handling
   - Implement better retry strategies for failed requests
   - Add more detailed logging for debugging

## Next Steps

1. Test both successful and error scenarios thoroughly
2. Implement remaining API features (streaming, etc.)
3. Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
4. Consider adding response caching for frequently used prompts
5. Implement proper rate limiting handling

## Notes for Next Session

- Focus on testing the Deepseek integration thoroughly
- Consider implementing streaming responses for better user experience
- Look into adding proper rate limiting handling
- Consider adding response caching for optimization
