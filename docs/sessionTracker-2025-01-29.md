# Session Tracker: 2025-01-29

## Session Metadata

- **Date:** 2025-01-29
- **Start Time:** 10:27 AM (Europe/London, UTC+0:00)
- **End Time:** 3:37 PM (Europe/London, UTC+0:00)
- **Phase:** Code Refactoring & Integration Improvements

## Session Summary

This session focused on improving the model integration and refactoring the codebase for better maintainability.

### Code Refactoring

Broke down the large route file into modular components:

1. **Model-Specific Handlers**
   - `src/lib/models/deepseek.ts`: Deepseek API integration
   - `src/lib/models/claude.ts`: Claude API integration
   
2. **Shared Types**
   - `src/lib/types/models.ts`: Common interfaces and types
   
3. **Utilities**
   - `src/lib/utils/async.ts`: Timeout and async utilities

### Integration Improvements

- **Deepseek Integration**:
  - Enhanced prompt structure for better responses
  - Improved content/reasoning extraction
  - Added multiple pattern matching for reasoning
  - Enhanced error handling and logging

- **Claude Integration**:
  - Improved prompt for using Deepseek's reasoning
  - Better context preservation
  - Enhanced error handling

### Architecture Changes

- Modified chat API route to:
  - Handle temporary sessions for comparisons
  - Implement automatic cleanup of temporary sessions
  - Use standardized reasoning extraction across models
  - Improve error handling and logging
- Created a modular architecture:
  ```
  src/
    ├── lib/
    │   ├── models/
    │   │   ├── deepseek.ts
    │   │   └── claude.ts
    │   ├── types/
    │   │   └── models.ts
    │   └── utils/
    │       └── async.ts
    └── app/
        └── api/
            └── chat/
                └── route.ts
  ```

## Files Modified

- Created:
  - `src/lib/models/deepseek.ts`
  - `src/lib/models/claude.ts`
  - `src/lib/types/models.ts`
  - `src/lib/utils/async.ts`
- Modified:
  - `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
  - `src/app/compare/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/chat/message-list.tsx`
- Updated:
  - `docs/currentTask.md`
  - `docs/codebaseSummary.md`
  - `docs/sessionTracker-2025-01-29.md`

## Decisions Made

1. **Reasoning Standardization:**
   - Chose to use Deepseek's native reasoning output.
   - Implemented specific reasoning prompts for Claude.
   - Maintained conversation context for better coherence.

2. **Analysis Framework:**
   - Required quotes for all analysis points.
   - Added practical implications section.
   - Enhanced synthesis requirements.

3. **Session Management:**
   - Implemented temporary sessions for comparisons.
   - Added automatic cleanup.
   - Used timestamp-based unique IDs.

4. **Code Organization:**
    - Separated model-specific code into dedicated files.
    - Created shared types for better TypeScript support.
    - Extracted common utilities.

## Technical Details

### Reasoning Request Structure
```typescript
// First request: Get direct response
const response = await axiosInstance.post("/chat/completions", {
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: message }]
})

// Second request: Get detailed reasoning
const reasoningResponse = await axiosInstance.post("/chat/completions", {
  messages: [
    // Include original conversation
    { role: "user", content: message },
    { role: "assistant", content: content },
    // Add reasoning prompt
    { role: "user", content: "Explain your reasoning..." }
  ]
})
```

```

## Challenges Faced

1. **Dropdown Menu Issues**: Resolved issues with ref forwarding and component hierarchy
2. **New Chat State**: Fixed problems with automatic session loading
3. **Deepseek API Integration**: Addressed timeout issues and invalid response formats
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error capture and display throughout the application
5. **Session Management:**
   - Handling temporary sessions without database pollution.
